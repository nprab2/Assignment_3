# Washington Redistricting Project
Course Assignment
Developed by: Thomas W. Miller
Revised: September 18, 2024

## Overview
This assignment involves a collaborative effort among Team East Coast (and Peru). Our team focused on creating a fair and equitable redistricting plan for the state of Washington. 

## Objectives
The goal of this assignment is to explore constrained optimization and integer programming by:

- Gathering relevant demographic and geographic data.
- Defining objectives and constraints for a redistricting plan.
- Formulating and solving the redistricting problem using integer programming techniques.
- Redistricting is the process by which political district boundaries are drawn, impacting electoral representation. As noted by political strategist Thomas B. Hofeller, redistricting enables politicians to select their voters rather than vice versa. This project will address the complexities of creating a fair redistricting map for Washington, using data from the 2020 U.S. Census.
