# Assignment_3

This assignment will address the challenge of redistricting in Washington state. We will aim to create fair and equitable congressional districts. By utilizing constrained optimization 
and integer programming. Our team will be doing a deep dive into this situation to create a plan that will help balance population and geographic requirements, We start by collecting county-level 
data such as population and geographic adjacent counties. The goal is to assign each of the counties to a certain district, by balancing the population across the different districts. 
Our team will be utilizing Python PuLP and GIS tools to handle the computational challenges. We will then document these processes and results. We will try to present a fair data-driven 
redistricting solution for the Washington states
